PRIVATE ISLAND MARKET REPORT – 2025
===================================

Overview:

The global private island market in 2025 has continued to attract ultra-high-net-worth individuals, investors, and eco-conscious developers. While geopolitical tensions and climate risks remain key considerations, interest in self-sustaining and remote retreats has surged post-pandemic. 

Key Trends:

1. Increased Demand for Developed Islands
   - Islands with existing infrastructure (docks, power, housing) are in high demand.
   - Turnkey properties like Terra’s Key in Florida fetch premium prices.

2. Sustainability as a Selling Point
   - Buyers prioritize solar/wind power, water catchment, and eco-friendly architecture.
   - Islands marketed as "green-ready" attract more interest from eco-resort developers.

3. Strong Activity in Key Regions
   - Caribbean & Central America: Belize, Bahamas, and Panama remain hotspots.
   - South Pacific: Fiji and French Polynesia offer resort-scale leases.
   - North America: Canadian islands in Ontario and BC draw nature-seeking buyers.
   - Europe: Greek and Scandinavian islands offer heritage and seclusion.

4. Pricing Trends
   - Entry-level: <$500,000 for small undeveloped islands (e.g., parts of Nova Scotia, Panama).
   - Mid-tier: $1M–$10M for developed or medium-scale potential.
   - Luxury: $20M–$100M+ for fully developed estates (e.g., Kaibu Island, Fiji).

5. Legal and Regulatory Considerations
   - Buyers face varied regulations: e.g., foreign ownership limits in Thailand, EU protections.
   - Title and leasehold clarity critical—Panama and Fiji offer long leases but require due diligence.
