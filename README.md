A private island is a tract of land completely surrounded by water that is owned by an individual, corporation, or group rather than a government or public entity. These islands can range from small, undeveloped parcels of land to large, fully functioning estates with homes, infrastructure, and resort-style amenities. Ownership grants the ability to control access and development, often offering unparalleled privacy and exclusivity. However, purchasing and maintaining a private island also comes with a range of logistical and legal challenges. These include transportation limitations, local and international property laws, environmental concerns, and the need for independent utilities such as freshwater systems, power generation, and waste disposal. Depending on the location, there can also be risks associated with natural disasters like hurricanes or rising sea levels.
